A lowrezjam game

Important facets for the general publics adoration:
- Short. Pick it up in 30 seconds. Fully playable in 10 minutes. (Skip level button? Make sure players get past the intro screen[VB]. Get testers!) Exported to HTML. Easy to run/light.
- Nice to play. Most early edges polished off(ram could feel funner to handle. nore drifting. screenshake. stomping noise/music). No annoying/frustrating pain points. (Rat juice. Tight game loop.)
- Looks nice and impresive. Tight integration of music with the game. The art is good already ;)

Intro: being worked on
- Level 1: Introductory. Some story/poem about how its a nice lil farm in nice lil valley. Few secs to give the player a handle on the ram. Dang rats!
- Level 2: More rats. Surprise, a wolf. MORE story since we are already running out of new things.
- #Level 3: Way too many mice. Some wolves. meh, maybe we can let this one go.
- level 4: There is one sheep. There are many mice and wolves. Its tough and sad. Rainy level is used here.
- Maybe theres some summary screen with the number of mice/wolves bonked and sheep/barn food lost.
