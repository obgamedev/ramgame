the ram protects it's herd
from the wolves

there is no canine companion

first the rats came, and they ate the food
the traps flowing full and rotting

soundless critkets the only companion to the four bad-weather friends
out there, almost a sound, echoes of allies

the bushes grow in the hidden valley
forgotten

rain taps dissapear into the dehydrated ground
so ground drinks the rainwater
the pail is empty
why will no one come?

(this is too damn sad)

mood correction: melancholic. kind of like Edmund McMillen games - triachnid. its cute, theres nice moments, but its a little sad
